# UAV_with_arm_in_pybullet 

This is a project for UAV flight control and embedded design.

A quadrotor with a robotic arm is designed with a Hummingbird drone and a DOFBOT robot arm and the URDF model of the drone is established.

The drone is futher simulated in the simulation with Pybullet with the simulation environment of gym-pybullet-drones to achieve the PID control of the drone.
